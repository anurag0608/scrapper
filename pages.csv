0,61a5f9d94f76a65d7af50d03," ||  Air India Pilot unions threaten industrial action from December 1The unions want what they call an 'illegal pay cut of 55%' as well as longstanding issues around the airline’s divestment to be addressed within three days Ashwini Phadnis November 30, 2021 / 02:34 PM IST Representative Image The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) and Indian Pilots Guild have threatened “industrial action” from December 1 if the “illegal pay cut of 55 per cent” and “plethora of longstanding disinvestment issues” are not addressed within three days by Air India.There are about 1,000 pilots in the two unions, and any industrial action will affect both domestic and international operations.Recently, the Tata group emerged as the top bidder for full ownership of the national carrier.“With the resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services to/ from India from December 15th, 2021, and all airlines rolling back the COVID cut, If we do not see the issues related to an illegal pay cut of 55 per cent and the plethora of longstanding disinvestment issues addressed within three days we will have no choice but to seek justice through ‘Industrial Action,’” ICPA and IPG said in a letter dated November 29 to former Air India Chairman and Managing Director and current Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Bansal.Sources said that notice of 14 days — and not three days — has to be given for industrial action.Close Related stories Tata group to set up solar plant worth Rs 3,000 crore in Tamil Nadu: ReportThe new Air India will need a game plan for new competitionWinter schedule kicks off with new long and short routes of Indian airlines ICPA and IPG had written a similar letter on November 17.ICPA represents the narrow-body pilots of Air India, who primarily operate the airline’s Airbus A320 fleet, while IPG represents pilots who fly the wide-body Boeing 777 and Boeing 787, which the airline uses for long-haul flights to Europe, the US, Canada and Australia.Normally, industrial action means that the pilots could go on work to rule (strictly go by the book on timings and rules), which could reduce efficiency and disrupt Air India’s domestic and international operations.Pilots who operate Air India’s long-haul flights say the decision to cut their pay is wrong, noting how they had risked their lives and flew to Covid-hit countries at the height of the pandemic.The pilots say that Air India did not consider the risks they exposed themselves to (five pilots died during these evacuation flights) and instead went in for pay cuts in April 2020. The pilots claim that in July 2020, their salaries were cut with retrospective effect, also covering the period when they flew the evacuation flights during the pandemic.The pilots operated flights to various countries, including Italy and the UK, when the pandemic was spreading earlier this year.According to the pilots, the last time they got their full salaries was March 2020.A query sent to Air India on what impact the industrial action could have on flight schedules or whether the pilots’ demands were being considered did not immediately elicit a response. Ashwini Phadnis is a senior journalist based in New Delhi.

Priyanka Sahay November 30, 2021 / 02:25 PM IST Flipkart’s social commerce platform Shopsy has grown fourfold in terms of revenue during the festive period as compared to the non-festive season, the company said in a statement on November 30.The growth in October was led by categories such as fashion, beauty, home and general merchandise.E-commerce companies ran festive sales during October and November in a staggered manner.While Flipkart did not comment on specific numbers, according to sources, Shopsy hit the $100 million mark last month on the back of festive sales. Moneycontrol has also learnt that Flipkart has set a GMV target of $1.5 billion for Shopsy alone by the end of 2022.Launched earlier this year, with Shopsy, Flipkart aims to take social commerce to a different level. The app allows anybody on social media to become a reseller of products featured on the online marketplace and earn a small commission.The e-commerce platform hopes to popularise online shopping among the growing community of internet users in the country.Close Related stories Best deals on smartphones during Flipkart's Black Friday Sale: iPhone 12, Motorola Edge 20 Pro, and ...Why is Meesho a bigger threat to Flipkart than Amazon?Flipkart vs Meesho: A new war in Indian e-commerce There are likely to be 900 million active internet users in India by 2025, as higher adoption takes off in rural areas. Individuals spend almost three hours a day on the internet, mostly messaging, social media networking and watching videos. Online shopping is barely in the cart of these people, the reason being lack of trust and technical complexity.""With the next 200 million digital consumers coming from Tier 2 and 3 cities, we want to build a community that truly democratises commerce in the country. The social commerce landscape in the country is evolving at a fast pace, and with Shopsy we are building a sustainable platform backed by our technology prowess. Small businesses and sellers see immense benefit on what Shopsy as a platform has to offer them ­-­­­­— ranging from zero commission to free shipping facilities,"" said Prakash Sikaria, Senior Vice President, Growth and Monetisation, Flipkart.The company has 2.5 lakh sellers on the platform who provide 150 million products across 250 categories. It is on track to enable over 25 million online entrepreneurs by 2023.Shopsy competes with Softbank-backed Meesho.

Hong, File) The Centre on Tuesday extended the nation-wide COVID-19 containment measures till December 31 in view of the emergence of a highly mutant COVID-19 variant Omicron in some countries and asked the states to be vigilant.In a communication, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also asked states and UTs to strictly adhere to the November 25 advisory issued by the Union Health Ministry, recommending rigorous screening and testing of all international arrivals.Bhalla also said that the contacts of the international travellers must be closely tracked and tested as per the health ministry guidelines, and the samples of travellers turning positive sent to the designated Genome Sequencing Laboratories promptly, as per the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) Guidance Document.He said the state surveillance officers must also establish close coordination with their designated or tagged genome sequencing laboratories for expediting results of genomic analysis, and the States and UTs should immediately undertake necessary public health measures, in case of the presence of variants of concern.Accordingly, the home secretary directed that the existing ""Prompt and Effective Containment Measures for COVID-19"" must be continued till December 31.Close COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

The death toll climbed to 4,68,980 with 190 fresh fatalities, according to the data.

0,61a5f9e14f76a65d7af50d0b," ||  Farm Bills Repealed | Will this change political equations in Western Uttar Pradesh?Farmers’ protests, and the repeal of the three farm laws are not the only factors that will influence the 2022 poll results in Western Uttar Pradesh. The scars of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, and counter polarisation are important factors Amitabh Tiwari November 30, 2021 / 12:33 PM IST Farmers protest after a car owned by Junior Home Minister Ajay Mishra ran over protesting farmers in the Uttar Pradesh town of Lakhimpur Kheri and killed 4 farmers, officials and farm leaders said.(Image: AP) On November 29, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government passed a Bill to cancel the three farm laws that were passed in Parliament in September 2020.The Narendra Modi government has gone back on its proposed agriculture reforms with a hope that it would neutralise the impact of the year-long farmers’ protests in western Uttar Pradesh (UP), and prevent the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) from gaining a political upper hand in the assembly elections that are to be held early next year.On the groundThe farmer protests are anchored by Jat leader Rakesh Tikait. Jats hold substantial influence in Western UP districts of Meerut, Bulandshahar, Aligarh, Mathura, Baghpat, Hathras, Saharanpur, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Agra, Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar.Jats account for 10-25 percent of the population in these districts. They have a standalone influence in 35-40 assembly seats, on which the RLD is likely to contest in alliance with the SP. This region also has a minority population of around 26 percent, which is more than the state average.Close Related stories Centre ignoring demand for caste census: BSP Supremo MayawatiCorruption allegations: Anil Deshmukh appears before inquiry commissionNational Employment policy may have sector-specific job targets: Sources Together, the Jats and the Muslims become a potent force in Western UP with a population anywhere between 25-60 percent. Their vote could be a deciding factor in 76 assembly seats, a little over one-fifth of the house strength of UP (403). This is where they become a significant force.The Jats have been traditional backers of the RLD, while the minorities have been consolidating behind the SP in recent polls. Since the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, the Jats have been backing the BJP in the 2014, 2017, and 2019 elections. In 2017, the BJP swept the region bagging 65 of these 76 seats.Jats And MuslimsIt’s fairly complex to gauge the impact of the farmers’ protest, and its subsequent repeal on the political dynamics and equations in the region. Farmers of the region have been up in arms against the farm laws, and the BJP. However, the repeal may force a rethink among a section of Jats, who could stick with the BJP (as they have done since 2014).Former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh created this voting block of the Jats, and the Muslims. Members of the minority community used to work as labourers in agriculture fields owned by the Jats. Thus, their fortunes were intertwined, and from the 1970s till the 1990s they largely voted in tandem.Charan Singh’s son Ajit Singh’s flirtatious stints with the BJP, and his opportunist moves from socialists to the Congress to the BJP created suspicion among the minorities. The two groups, eventually, began to drift apart. The Muzaffarnagar riots further strained ties.Complex EquationsA proposed RLD-SP alliance on the pretext of farmer protests is an attempt to bridge this trust deficit between the Jats and the Muslims to defeat the common enemy, the BJP. However, the scars run deep, and overcoming suspicions on both sides would not be easy.The Jats are well off landlords, and rich farmers, and are not specifically liked by the poor and backward Hindu communities. The Jats joining hands with the Muslims in the region has the potential to create counter polarisation which the SP-RLD alliance needs to be cautious of.Such polarisation may help the BJP consolidate votes in the name of Hindutava, and deflect attention from failures on price rise, unemployment, agri/rural distress, and even reports of COVID-19 mismanagement.The region also has a sizeable Dalit population. Consequently, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has good support in Western UP, and surveys suggest that BSP chief Mayawati is still holding onto her core vote block. A division in the opposition vote could help the BJP in this region.It is because of these nuances that initial opinion polls still show the BJP leading in Western UP. The C-Voter gives it 40-42 seats. A complex interplay of a tumultuous ties between the Jats and the Muslims, antagonism among other Hindu voters, the Dalit factor, Hindutava, would determine the impact of farmers’ protests/repeal on poll outcome in Western UP. In the next few months we will need to watch which direction the agitation takes from here. Can Tikait keep alive the protests by demanding a guarantee of MSP? Would the Jats take the apology of the Prime Minister and move on? Only time will tell. Amitabh Tiwari is a former corporate and investment banker-turned political strategist and commentator.

0,61a5f9e24f76a65d7af50d0d," ||  These are the countries that shut borders due to Omicron, the new COVID variantA new, heavily mutated Covid-19 variant spread across the globe on November 28, shutting borders, renewing curbs, and sparking fears for the fight against the nearly two-year-old coronavirus pandemic. Dubbed Omicron, the strain has cast doubt on global efforts to battle the pandemic because of fears that it is highly infectious, forcing countries to reimpose measures many had hoped were a thing of the past. Moneycontrol News November 29, 2021 / 06:56 PM IST A new, heavily mutated Covid-19 variant spread across the globe on November 28, shutting borders, renewing curbs, and sparking fears for the fight against the nearly two-year-old coronavirus pandemic. Dubbed Omicron, the strain has cast doubt on global efforts to battle the pandemic because of fears that it is highly infectious, forcing countries to reimpose measures many had hoped were a thing of the past. Scientists are racing to determine the threat posed by the heavily mutated strain -- particularly whether it can evade existing vaccines. (Image: AFP) With many European nations, including Germany and France, already bringing back curbs to counter surges in infections, Swiss voters broadly backed a proposed COVID pass law in a referendum on November 28. (Image: AFP) Mask-wearing will again be mandatory in shops and on public transport in England. All passengers arriving in Britain will have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until negative. Health Secretary Avid Javid said new COVID rules will be enforced from November 30. (Image: AFP) A long list of countries have already imposed travel restrictions on southern Africa, where it was first detected, including key travel hub Qatar, the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Netherlands. Angola became the first southern African country to suspend all flights from its regional neighbours Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa. (Image: AFP) Israel announced some of the strictest curbs, closing the borders to all foreigners -- just four weeks after reopening to tourists following a prolonged closure due to COVID. Israeli citizens will be required to present a negative PCR test and quarantine for three days if they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus and seven days if they have not. (Image: AFP) The Philippines has temporarily suspended a decision to allow fully vaccinated tourists entry in a bid to prevent a new, heavily mutated coronavirus variant taking off in the country where most of the population remains unvaccinated. (Image: AFP) Canada on November 28 has detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain of COVID, in two people who had travelled recently to Nigeria. On November 27, Canada banned travel from seven African countries over concerns about the spread of the Omicron strain. Nigeria was not one of them. (Image: AFP) On November 29 Japan announced to shut borders to foreign travelers from around the world as the new coronavirus variant spreads. Japan will bar entry to foreigners from midnight on November 29 and Japanese returnees from specified nations will have to quarantine in designated facilities, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said. (Image: AFP) The speed at which governments slammed their borders shut took many by surprise, with travelers thronging Johannesburg international airport, desperate to squeeze onto the last flights to countries that had imposed sudden travel bans. (Image: AFP) The virus strain has already slipped through the net, and has now been found everywhere from the Netherlands to Hong Kong and Australia, where authorities on November 28 said they had detected it for the first time in two passengers from southern Africa who were tested after flying into Sydney. The arrival of the new variant comes just a month after Australia lifted a ban on travelling overseas without permission.

0,61a5f9e84f76a65d7af50d11," ||  Mundra Drug Seizure | DRI records Adani Ports statement under NDPS ActAPSEZ is the operator of Mundra Port, where a total of 2,988.21 kg of heroin, estimated to be worth over Rs 20,000 crore, was seized on September 13. Moneycontrol News November 30, 2021 / 03:41 PM IST Representative image The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has recorded the statement of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) over the seizure of nearly 3,000-kg of heroin from Gujarat’s Mundra Port, the finance ministry said on November 30.APSEZ is the operator of Mundra Port, where a total of 2,988.21 kg of heroin, worth over Rs 20,000 crore, was seized on September 13. This is reported to be one of the largest ever seizures across the world.Congress MP KC Venugopal raised a query in the Rajya Sabha, seeking a confirmation from the government over the drug seizure. He also requested the finance ministry to clarify whether any notice was issued or action taken against the port operator.“DRI has seized 2,988.21 kg of narcotic substance (Heroin) at Mundra Port on 13.09.2021,” Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said. “DRI recorded a statement of the port operator under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act, 1985, and the case has been taken over by the NIA (National Investigation Agency).” Also Read | Here’s why the Mundra drug seizure is a cause of concernClose Related stories Leaders of 12 opposition parties condemn Centre over suspension of Rajya Sabha membersAbout Rs 52,000 crore GST compensation pending to states till September: Finance MinistryBill to repeal farm laws to be brought in Rajya Sabha today itself: Pralhad Joshi On another sub-question by Venugopal, which sought to know what steps would be taken in the future to prevent the use of ports for illegal activities, the MoS Finance replied: “Customs formations, including DRI, keep constant vigil and take action in accordance with the law whenever such illegal activities are detected.”The consignment of heroin that was seized at Mundra Port had originated from Afghanistan. It was shipped from the Bandar Abbas Port in Iran.Following the seizure, a number of raids were conducted in different parts of the country, leading to the arrest of eight individuals, including an Uzbek and an Afghan nationals.APSEZ, which had come under criticism following the drug haul, had slammed the accusations being hurled at it. “No port operator across the country can examine a container. Their role is limited to running the port... APSEZ is a port operator, providing services to shipping lines. We have no policing authority over the containers or the millions of tonnes of cargo that pass through the terminals in Mundra or any of our ports,” it said.“We sincerely hope that this statement will put to rest the motivated, malicious and false propaganda being run on social media against the Adani Group,” the statement said.On October 11, APSEZ had decided that it will not handle any cargo originating from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan from November 15.

ADVERTISEMENT November 30, 2021 / 03:17 PM IST “India VIX in the domestic market was around 17-18 levels during most of November, indicating limited market downside. However, volatility spiked by 25% on Friday, 26th Nov, led by rising concerns on the new Covid-19 variant, making investors cautious. Further, an increase in the new variant cases will be a short-term negative for the equity market. Currently, VIX trading around 21 levels signifies an increase in cautiousness, as compared to the previous week. Volatility is likely to continue for some more time, as the direction of the new variant, Oil prices, and Dollar index will further drive the market fundamentals. FIIs are the net sellers in the equity market, especially from the last two weeks, and DIIs are consistently providing support. With every FIIs selling, here onwards, DIIs support will be critical for the market.

In addition, its distribution channels include large format stores (LFSs), and it also sell products through its own website and online marketplaces and through multi-brand outlets (MBOs).“Although the business model looks good with strengths like efficient product portfolio and a good supply chain, this company is still vulnerable to factors like changing consumer spending patterns, unable to adjust to changing preferences and a possible slowdown due to the new variant of COVID which has caused the markets to correct themselves,” said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research.Garg said he would advise investors to book profits on the listing gain if they do not have a long-term view. “Investors must wait for decent correction to acquire it from the secondary market. Looking at the market conditions, now it is advisable for investors who want to buy on secondary market to wait till the price comes down to Rs 700-750.”Go Fashion posted a loss of Rs 3.54 crore in FY21 as against a profit of Rs 52.63 crore in previous year, on a revenue of Rs 250.66 crore, down from Rs 392 crore.

Four factors behind revivalStrong global cues, unlikely lockdowns from omicron strain, economic recovery and revival in some key sectors help markets ragain Sandip Das November 30, 2021 / 12:03 PM IST Stock market,share market The Indian stock market seems to have shrugged off the intensifying fears of the new COVID strain with the Sensex scaling 903.03 points, or 1.58 percent, to 58,163.61, and the Nifty climbing 265.50 points, or 1.56 percent, to 17,319.50 at 10.34am.Sectors like realty, capital goods, banks and financial spaces gained the most, adding 2-4 percent each, while the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices were up over 2 percent each.However, the equity markets has come off the day's high with Sensex up 108.76 points at 57369.34 at 12:00 hours and the Nifty adding 29.40 points at 17083.40.Catch all the market action on our live blogLet’s take a look at the factors that helped the market regain.Close Related stories Trade Spotlight | What should you do with Dr Lal PathLabs, PNB Housing Finance, Navin Fluorine, and ...Star Health and Allied Insurance Company IPO – Should you subscribe to it?Trade setup for Tuesday: Top 15 things to know before Opening Bell Strong global cuesGlobal equity markets, including the Wall Street, closed higher, regaining some of the grounds lost in Friday’s sell-off, as investors were hopeful that the omicron variant of coronavirus would not lead to lockdowns after reassurance from US President Joe Biden.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 236.6 points, or 0.68 percent, to 35,135.94, the S&P 500 gained 60.65 points, or 1.32 percent, to 4,655.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 291.18 points, or 1.88 percent, to 15,782.83.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.52 percent higher on Tuesday. In Australia, the S&P/ASX200 was up 1.15 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei (.N225) was trading 1.2 percent higher early in the session.Economic disruption unlikelyGlobally, investors became cautiously optimistic that the omicron variant might not cause a widespread global economic disruption, with Asian shares trading in the positive territory and the US government saying that lockdowns were off the table.Hopes of economic recoveryIndia’s statistics ministry will announce the gross domestic product (GDP) data and economists have projected that the data will show 8.4 percent year-on-year growth in the July-September period, according to a Reuters poll. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has cut key interest rates to record lows and infused massive liquidity to shore up economy, is widely expected to suck out excess liquidity before normalising rates amid growing inflationary concerns. RBI has forecast an annual growth of 9.5 percent for this fiscal year.Uptick in realty, banks and financials The realty index jumped over 4 percent, led by Sobha, Indiabulls Real Estate, Godrej Properties, Sunteck Realty, DLF and Oberoi Realty, while from the financial space, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, along with Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank, were top gainers.Technical viewsGaurav Garg, Head of Research, Capitalvia Global ResearchThe Indian benchmarks started the day on a positive note amid supportive global cues. There will be some caution as the omicron variant of COVID-19 adds new uncertainties to the global economic outlook. Support may come as India ratings expects the economy to grow 8.3 percent in Q2 and close the year with 9.4 percent in FY22.There may be some reaction in aviation stocks as the government said investments worth Rs 91,000 crore will be made for developing existing and new airports. The levels of 16,800-16,900 may act as an important support levels in the market. We can expect it to trade in the range of 16,800-17,400.Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal InvestmentsThe market bounced today to the positive territory. Whether it is a short covering or a dead cat bounce is still to be ascertained. The markets are still in the negative territory and unless we do not close above 17,500 on the Nifty, the short-term trend will not change.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

0,61a5fa0c4f76a65d7af50d35," ||  Daily Voice | Earnings upgrade to take a pause as input cost weighs on India Inc margins, says Pankaj Tibrewal of Kotak AMC'The US Dollar Index is inversely related to Indian stocks and rising DXY index could be a source of volatility in coming months' Sunil Shankar Matkar November 30, 2021 / 09:06 AM IST The best of market breadth is behind us and, going forward, while earnings of overall index remains durable, there would be greater dispersion of winners and losers, suggesting that it could be a stock-pickers’ market, believes Pankaj Tibrewal, Equity Fund Manager at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.The US Dollar Index (DXY) is inversely related to Indian stocks and the rising DXY index could be a source of volatility in the coming months, according to him.“The earnings upgrade cycle, which has been supportive of the markets over the last few quarters should take a pause as input cost pressures weigh on the margins of Corporate India,” says the seasoned professional with exposure to the mutual fund industry and experience in managing a host of debt and equity schemes.Do you think the market is expected to correct more in the coming months, even after falling more than 6 percent from record highs?This has been a good year for the Indian equities. India appears to be in a structural uptrend with a likely new profit cycle, improvement in capex trends and supportive policy environment. However, in the near term, we are cautious on the overall markets.Close Related storiesPankaj TibrewalSenior VP & Fund Manager (Equity)|Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company DAILY VOICE | Don't see a major correction, positive on market from 3-year perspective: Pankaj Tibre...Here are 5 ways in which investors can value company based on fundamental factorsJ&K Bank Q4 Net Profit seen up 211.3% YoY to Rs. 88.4 cr: KotakAbsolute valuations for India remain well above the historical averages and positive earnings revision which we see is concentrated mainly in the commodities sector.Going ahead, in our view, the earnings upgrade cycle, which has been supportive of the markets over the last few quarters, should take a pause as input cost pressures weigh on the margins of Corporate India. Strong performance of Indian markets has led to Indian equities premium to emerging markets (EM) equities going up to decade-high levels.In our view, the best of the market breadth is behind us and going forward, while earnings of the overall index remains durable, there would be greater dispersion of winners and losers, suggesting that it could be a stock pickers market.Also read - Which are the best passive mutual funds for your portfolio?What could be the reasons behind the significant FII selling taking place in the equity market? What is the indication you get from gradual rising in the US dollar index?The 2021 flows are at $8.3 billion, but the bulk of it came in the first three months of the year, while flows since April 2021 to till date are only around $1 billion. In our discussion, FII investors seem to believe that there is better value elsewhere, given India’s strong rally this year. MSCI India Index has outperformed the MSCI EM Index by almost 30 percent in 2021 till date.The US Dollar Index (DXY) is inversely related to Indian stocks and rising DXY index could be a source of volatility in the coming months.Do you think investors should be more cautious on the equity market now and shift focus to other asset classes?Also read - IPO-bound SaaS Company RateGain expects global acquisitions to lift profits as travel picks upWe believe that after a sharp rally in the market over the last 18 months, investors should exert some caution in the near term. This has been the third longest rally in the markets without even 10 percent correction. The advice to investors would be not to invest in equity markets looking at the past one-year returns. After the strong rally, one should moderate return expectations going forward.Also, equities as an asset class can be volatile in the short to medium term. One might even see a sharp drop in portfolio value and that too suddenly. So only those who are willing to fathom this kind of volatility should invest in them.We would advise investors to follow asset allocation and be disciplined in their investment approach. At the current juncture, anyone considering fresh investments, can stagger their investments through Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) or Systematic Transfer Plan (STP).What are the key themes that you are betting on for 2022?Well, let’s go down the preferred themes one by one. Revival of residential real estateWe are positive on is the revival of the residential real estate cycle led by lower mortgage rates, best affordability in the last two-and-a-half decades, stagnant property prices and need for bigger houses after COVID. We are positive on the home improvement and building material space and believe that real estate ancillary industries are the best proxy to ride the revival in residential real estate.Big becoming bigger, strong getting strongerThe theme of consolidation and market share gains within sectors continues to play out. We seek to focus on sectoral leaders, companies, which are gaining market share in their sectors. The shift from the unorganised to the organised continues and company balance sheets by and large are stronger now than a few years ago.Revival of investment cycleCorporate India has deleveraged over the last few years and balance sheet of India Inc are in good shape after COVID. Most corporates across sectors are looking to deploy the cash flows back on expansion. Also PLI and ‘China plus one’ helping the investment cycle. We are positive on capital goods and industrial sector.What is the top wall of worries the market is going to face?An upward shift in the US interest rate cycle, rising oil prices, a potential third wave of COVID-19, higher domestic rates, strong trailing outperformance versus emerging markets (30ppt over six months) and exuberance in the broad market are expected to be the top wall of worries that the market is going to face in coming months.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Top performing funds have been selected after sorting 1Y returns. You can use this table to check the track record of these mutual funds.If the 1Y column for the mutual fund entry in the first row reads 12.54%, it means that if you had invested in that mutual fund 1 year ago then your money would have grown by 12.54%. (Rs. 100 would have grown to Rs. 112.54). Also remember that returns for periods above 1 year are annualised. This means that if the 3Y column reads 12.54% then your money would have grown 12.54% every year over the last 3 years. So Rs.100 invested 3 years ago would have become Rs.112.54 after the first year and the value of your investment today would be Rs. 154.54....

Top performing funds have been selected after sorting 1Y returns. You can use this table to check the track record of these mutual funds.If the 1Y column for the mutual fund entry in the first row reads 12.54%, it means that if you had invested in that mutual fund 1 year ago then your money would have grown by 12.54%. (Rs. 100 would have grown to Rs. 112.54). Also remember that returns for periods above 1 year are annualised. This means that if the 3Y column reads 12.54% then your money would have grown 12.54% every year over the last 3 years. So Rs.100 invested 3 years ago would have become Rs.112.54 after the first year and the value of your investment today would be Rs. 154.54....

Navneet Dubey October 27, 2017 / 12:55 PM IST Mutual funds are attracting huge investment interest. In September 2017, Equity funds (including ELSS) witnessed monthly net inflow at Rs. 18,936 crores, a growth of 406% YoY. The net inflow signifies the overall sentiment of the mutual fund investors, according to an ICRA report. The huge investor interest is due to the variety of mutual fund offerings which can cater to every investor’s financial goals.Manish Kothari, Head of Mutual Funds, Paisabazaar.com points out someone with a high-risk appetite can invest in a mix of large/mid-cap and multi-cap funds while those with moderate risk appetite can opt for equity-oriented balanced funds. “Those with lower risk appetite may opt for debt funds, debt-oriented balanced funds or dynamic asset allocation funds,” he added.Moreover, the duration ranges from one day to a lifetime as funds are invested across asset classes like gold, equities, long-term bonds, short-term bonds & cash. The schemes are also designed as per the investors risk taking capacity.So what makes mutual funds such an attractive investment avenue? Bhartendra Singh, Head of Product for Investment and Insurance Marketplace, Wishfin has explained the benefits that mutual funds offer to outweigh those offered by conventional investment methods.

These funds are managed by experienced & qualified fund managers whose job is to take investment decisions based on solid research & investment processes. Managing risk is an important consideration while taking investment decisions. Often people do not have the time & expertise to carry out research and are not able to put a focused effort to monitor markets & economies. On the other hand, a fund manager’s job it is to keep a track of all these variables and churn his portfolio to maximise investor returns.Managing your goalsPeople have different dreams & goals and mutual funds can help realise them through a range of different products available. Be it your child’s education, buying a house, retirement planning, and second income generation, creating an emergency corpus, planning a vacation, creating a corpus over a period or just saving money for the short term.Portfolio DiversificationOne of the main advantages of mutual funds is that unlike a lot of other investment vehicles, it helps you create a diversified and balanced portfolio. So while some portion of investment can have equity exposure to provide long-term growth, it can also be balanced with fixed income products to manage the risk for providing regular income.Ease of investment & monitoringAn investor can start with a small amount of Rs 500 per month or a lump sum amount. There are online platforms available that will allow them to invest right from their desk. Not only do mutual funds have different modes of investment, they also allow all types of investment amounts by switching funds. It makes the process of accessing the portfolio details, account statements and making systematic investments very easy.One can invest through multiple modes of transaction: SIP (Systematic investment plan) automates the investment over a fixed frequency, One-time Investment in a new fund & adding the amount in the same fund, switching from one fund to another fund, systematically withdrawing money from the investments or transferring to other funds.Liquidity & Tax BenefitsMutual funds offer high liquidity by allowing redemptions at any time required unless it is invested in a closed-ended fund. In fact, some mutual funds have started offering instant redemptions facility through liquid funds wherein money comes back to the registered bank account instantly. It’s like keeping the money in a bank account with the potential to earn better returns. Liquid funds can be very good alternatives to fixed deposits.An equity-linked saving scheme (ELSS) is the type of an open-ended diversified equity fund which not only offers tax exemptions under section (u/s) 80C of the Indian Income Tax Act but also gives your money an opportunity to grow.Regulations and TransparencyMutual fund companies are strongly regulated by SEBI making the entire process of investment very transparent. Mutual fund companies disclose all the details of investment periodically as a part of the regulatory requirement. Investors can take comfort in investing as there is a regulator to protect their interest.

0,61a5fa174f76a65d7af50d3f," ||  Confused about how SIPs work? Here are the benefits of investing through this mode“Just as you pay EMIs each month towards loan repayments, in much the same way, SIPs are a method of investing regularly in mutual funds” Navneet Dubey August 10, 2018 / 10:54 AM IST Generally, it has been noticed that investors try to co-relate between these two words - mutual funds and SIPs and gets confused that how systematic investment plans, also called SIPs, actually work and make your investments profitable. Therefore, before making any investment, you as an investor should understand what a mutual fund is and how doing systematic investment planning helps you to achieve your financial goal over a period of time.To understand how SIPs work in mutual funds, let us first briefly know what mutual funds itself stand for. A mutual fund is a financial instrument, which comprises of several schemes where you pool your money along with other investors’ money, which then gets invested in stocks or bonds or a mix of the two (both stocks and bonds), depending on the type of mutual fund scheme you choose.The total investment made by a mutual fund, either in stocks/bonds, is then divided into units. You get units, based on the proportion of your investment (money you invest in the mutual fund). The value of the mutual fund is measured by its Net Asset Value (NAV). This is the value at which you (investor), buy and sell mutual funds.Systematic Investment Plan and its working mechanismSIPs are a method of investing in mutual funds. You invest a certain pre-determined amount at a regular interval in the mutual fund. This might be once each week, once each month or once in a quarter. If you have given ECS mandate, money will be automatically debited from your bank account and invested in the mutual fund scheme of your choice. Units of the mutual fund scheme are allocated based on the NAV (Net Asset Value) of the scheme for that day.Close Related stories Do you really need balanced advantage funds for your portfolio?These five large & midcap funds gave 52-56% in the last one year: Have you invested in them?Is your index fund quoting high tracking error? How are SIPs related to mutual funds? C.S. Sudheer, founder, indianmoney.com, said mutual funds are a professionally managed trusts, where money invested by you and other investors are pooled and invested in stocks, debt or a mix of stocks and debt, depending on the type of mutual fund. SIPs are just a method of investing in mutual funds and to understand better, one should know these difference between mutual fund and SIPs:=> Mutual funds are an investment. SIPs are a method of investing in mutual funds.=> Though SIPs are often associated with mutual funds, you can even invest in stocks through SIP.=> SIPs are like EMIs you pay on loans but in the opposite direction. “Just as you pay EMIs each month towards loan repayments, in much the same way, SIPs are a method of investing regularly in a mutual fund,” he added.How you get benefited from SIP?It is a smart and hassle-free method of investing in mutual funds. Through SIP you can invest a certain, fixed, pre-determined amount at regular intervals of time like once a week, month or quarter. Doing so, SIPs give you the twin major benefits of rupee cost averaging and the compounding benefit:Rupee Cost Averaging: With SIPs you don’t have to time the market. Rupee cost averaging helps you avoid the guessing game. SIPs encourage regular investing in mutual funds and your money fetches more units if NAV is low and fewer units if NAV is high. SIPs are an excellent way of investing, especially when markets are down, as you accumulate more units which help build a sizeable corpus with time.Power of compounding: If you invest in mutual funds via SIPs the returns you get earn returns and this is the compounding benefit. SIPs encourage long-term investing in mutual funds as earnings get re-invested giving even higher returns.

0,61a5fa194f76a65d7af50d41," ||  Here are the basic steps to pick a good equity mutual fund schemeSelecting an equity fund purely on the basis of its ‘star rating’ provided by portals or issuers is not a fool-proof fund selection method Navneet Dubey November 07, 2017 / 12:34 PM IST If you are thinking of investing in an equity mutual fund, you might find it difficult to decide which one to choose from within the vast array of funds on offer. It is difficult to figure out which one will do well in the future and give you returns that beat industry peers.However, if you follow a few basics while choosing the fund, chances are you might end up getting decent returns on your investments.Here are some important aspects of selecting a good mutual fund scheme:How to select the best fundThe process of effectively selecting an equity fund to match your requirement starts with a robust assessment of your own risk tolerance and your financial goals.Close Related stories Tariff hikes, moratorium on govt dues to help telecom companies invest more aggressively in 5G tech:...Fitch affirms ICICI Bank rating with negative outlookGrow up Visa, compete and not complain “It is a 'top-down' process rather than a 'bottom-up' one. For instance, you may be a moderate risk investor looking to start an SIP but your goal may be 15 years away. In such a case, you should explore options within the diversified equity category. Similarly, a risk-loving investor may want to consider a more volatile fund, such as a mid-cap fund, that has the potential to deliver a higher CAGR,” Mayank Bhatnagar, Chief Operating Officer, FinEdge told Moneycontrol.Also Read: How equity mutual funds can pave your way to becoming a 'crorepati'Where do investors go wrongBhatnagar pointed out that a lot of individual investors go ahead and select equity mutual fund schemes for wrong reasons. “For instance, we’ve seen a number of clients rushing into an equity scheme simply based on its one-year return. This more than often ends up backfiring; since short-term performance is usually the result of one or two alpha-generating stock picks, and does not typically extrapolate into the longer-term future. Similarly, selecting an equity fund purely on the basis of its ‘star rating’ provided by portals or issuers is not a fool-proof fund selection method. Succumbing to media hype created by smartly crafted ad-campaigns is another trap retail investors must watch out for,” he said.Things to check before parking your moneyHaving zeroed in on your most suitable fund category, you now need to select a fund within that space. As a thumb rule, go for a fund that has a strong vintage, and a track record of having navigated at least three complete market cycles.Bhatnagar further said an investor should evaluate how the fund management team reacted during tumultuous market phases, such as during the global financial crisis of 2008.Also Read: Can mutual funds help you generate tax-efficient monthly fixed income?“Check whether the fund is 'true to label' or capriciously chases momentum bets. Evaluate its 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year return vis-à-vis its category. Lastly, spare a moment to assess the fund manager at the helm. Chances are, he or she will need to maturely navigate more than one bear market during your investment tenure!“Avoid funds that are managed by greenhorn ‘whiz kids’, irrespective of the impressiveness of their academic credentials,” he added.Santosh Joseph, Founder and Managing Partner Germinate Wealth Solutions LLP says that there are three simple filters that can help you make a good decision.Company background: The investor should check the credentials of the promoters of the mutual fund company. Established and professional companies have sound policies and investment experience to ensure your money is safe and also well positioned to benefit from market movements.Portfolio/Fund Manager: The fund manager's track record and his ability to navigate market cycles successfully over long time periods is a great factor that one should study.The objective of the fund: Check on the ability of the fund sticking to the investment objective mandate. Avoid a fund which has frequent shifts to the overall theme or allocations.There are many who fall for the obvious past performance formula. There’s always a more intelligent option, it’s best to contact your advisor or mutual fund distributor to make an informed decision.

0,61a5fa1b4f76a65d7af50d43," ||  Do not make these 7 mistakes while investing in mutual fundsNever forget that you are investing because you have to achieve your financial goals. Investing without a goal is akin to travelling without a destination. Moneycontrol News July 11, 2018 / 11:40 AM IST If you have not invested in a mutual fund scheme till date, you are not trendy for sure. The monthly systematic investment plan (SIP) book of MFs have swollen to Rs 7,300 crore, underlining the preference of Indian investors in volatile financial markets. The idea behind most investments is wealth creation over a long period of time.However, not many make it to the wealthy end. There are several reasons behind the not so happy ending. While markets remain volatile and do not care about your investments, your own actions sometimes are detrimental to your dreams. Here is a list of mistakes MF investors must avoid to ensure one makes money by investing in mutual fund schemes.Ignoring your financial goalsThis should be the worst thing you can do while investing. Never forget that you are investing because you have to achieve your financial goals. Investing without a goal is akin to travelling without a destination.If you ignore your financial goals, you will end up investing in avenues that do not suit your needs. For example, if you have to accumulate Rs 1 lakh to pay for your child’s fees next year, it makes sense to start investing in a recurring deposit every month or put that money in a fixed deposits maturing at a time when you need it. But if you invest that money in an equity mutual fund, the market may give you a rude shock.Close Related stories These five large & midcap funds gave 52-56% in the last one year: Have you invested in them?Is your index fund quoting high tracking error?Which are the best passive mutual funds for your portfolio? The same holds true for long term investments such as retirement. “Never invest that money in a dividend option of a MF. It does not let the money compound as many times investors forget to reinvest dividend income. Introduction of dividend distribution tax on equity funds further eats into your returns,” says Abhinav Angirish, Founder and CEO of investoneline.in. He recommends investing in growth options of schemes if you are saving for long term financial goals.Trying to time the market over time in the marketWhile the SIP book is growing there is no dearth of investors who prefer to stand at the other extreme. These are these investors who prefer to time their investments to maximise their returns. Some even prefer to sell their investments when the markets appear overpriced. However, it does not work for most of them barring a few lucky folks. Some keep waiting for the markets to correct while others repent as to why they sold at the previous top.Instead, it makes sense to keep investing at regular interval and let your money grow over a long period of time. “Invest in equity fund through SIPs and hold your investments for the long term. This will help you overcome timing risk,” says Jitendra Solanki, Founder, JS Financial Advisors.Chasing high returnsFor many first time investors, the best way to choose MF schemes is to sort them based on their historical returns. However, it may not be the best way to do so. For example, if you have tried picking a debt fund in December 2016 on the basis of past returns, you would have definitely picked up a long-term gilt fund. Over the next 12 to 15 months, you would have burnt your fingers thanks to two factors: 1) Past returns were an outcome of falling interest rates; and 2) Interest rates rose in 2017 and 2018. One need to understand how mutual fund schemes work and not just rely on past numbers.Investing in too many schemes“This is one of the most common mistakes investor commit thinking that they are diversifying. They tend to forget that each MF scheme has a diversified portfolio of securities,” says Angirish. More schemes you buy, more difficult it becomes to keep a track of them. Instead build a portfolio of 2 or 3 well managed schemes and keep adding to your investments.Ignoring risk profile and asset allocationThis is pertinent in heady markets. Investors get carried away and suffer from the fear of missing out. “In a bull market, investors with moderate risk taking ability come under peer pressure, ignore their risk profile and invest in risky avenues such as equity funds. The bull markets further skews the balance in favour of equities,” observes Angirish. This situation may lead to big losses in case the markets take a U-turn, especially when investors opt for smallcap and midcap focussed schemes, as quick falls can evaporate gains earned over months and years.Solanki advises sticking to your risk profile. Instead of going with the crowd, it makes sense to strictly adhere to one’s asset allocation.Investing all your money at one goInvesting large sums in equity MFs is a tricky game. Not many investors can handle the situation emotionally. The best way to avoid it is to write all cheques and sign all the forms in one go or click wherever required at one go. However, this is not the best method. You are exposing yourself to timing risk. It makes sense to take a staggered approach to investing. “Systematic transfer plan helps you to invest at regular intervals and optimise your returns,” says Solanki.Not reviewingMutual funds are vehicles to invest in various asset classes such as gold, equity and bonds. Each fund manager has his way of making money for his investors and is governed by the scheme’s objective. The investors are expected to keep a track of his scheme’s performance from time to time. It makes sense to conduct a periodical review of all your MF schemes and weed out underperformers, if any. Failing to review can cost you a fortune.

IDCW As and When - Direct Growth - Direct IDCW As and When - Regular Growth - Regular Let's take an example, a mutual fund was priced (NAV) at Rs 100 one year back and fund gave 20% returns in last 1 year. Now for the growth option, today's mutual fund price (NAV) will be 120, so all profit/loss reflects in price of the fund. Whereas for the dividend option some amount out of Rs 20 profit may be given back to investor in form of dividend and today's NAV will be lower than 120. Go Category : Large Cap Fund These mutual funds select stocks for investment from the largest 100 stocks listed in the Indian markets (highest market capitalization). Larger stocks are expected to be less risky whereas smaller stocks may have higher potential to grow .Click on the category name to view all funds » Fund House : Tata Mutual Fund NAV This number shows latest NAV (Net Asset Value) and change in the NAV from previous day. NAV is nothing but the unit price for the fund. You will be allocated number of units based on this price. NAV is declared once each day generally at the end of the day. Once you invest in mutual funds, your money is further invested in stocks and bonds by mutual fund managers. Mutual Fund NAV is the per unit latest value of all such stocks/bonds held in the portfolio : ₹ 359.9719 -0.18% (as on 29th November, 2021) Invest Now Moneycontrol only allows transaction in direct funds Crisil Rank This shows how fund has historically performed compared to other funds in the category. If number of stars are higher then relative performance was better. You can read more about ranking methodology here Average performance among peers Fund Size This number represents how much money has been invested in these funds. This includes investment in both regular and direct plans and across all growth and dividend options. If the fund size is too small than fund may not get enough resources to put into research and management. If fund size if too large than fund may find it difficult to place money especially in mid and small cap segment. : ₹ 1102.23 Cr (0.5% of Investment in Category) Expense Ratio This is the annual fees, fund charges you to manage your money. You are not required to pay it explicitly but it is deducted from the NAV on a daily basis.

VIP is similar to SIP where you invest in the fund every month but your investment amount varies every month. How to achieve this? You can invest with simple formula: Let’s say you started VIP on 1st Jan, 2017 starting with ₹10000 and first instalment was processed at NAV of ₹100. Now if you want to change your investment amount by 10% for every 5% change in NAV then on all subsequent instalment dates, you need to check NAV and compare the same with first NAV (ie ₹100 in our example) and based on difference, you need to adjust amount. For example 1st Jan, 2018 NAV is 120 (which is higher by 20% from first NAV) than you need to reduce your investment by 40% (new instalment amount will be ₹6000).

Lower value indicates more predictable performance. So if you are comparing 2 funds (lets say Fund A and Fund B) in the same category. If Fund A and Fund B has given 9% returns in last 3 years, but Fund A standard deviation value is lower than Fund B. So you can say that there is a higher chance that Fund A will continue giving similar returns in future also whereas Fund B returns may vary. High volatility 21.24vs18.21 Category Avg BetaBeta value gives idea about how volatile fund performance has been compared to similar funds in the market. Lower beta implies the fund gives more predictable performance compared to similar funds in the market. So if you are comparing 2 funds (lets say Fund A and Fund B) in the same category. If Fund A and Fund B has given 9% returns in last 3 years, but Fund A beta value is lower than Fund B. So you can say that there is a higher chance that Fund A will continue giving similar returns in future also whereas Fund B returns may vary. High volatility 0.96vs0.83 Category Avg Sharpe RatioSharpe ratio indicates how much risk was taken to generate the returns. Higher the value means, fund has been able to give better returns for the amount of risk taken. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free return, defined as an Indian Government Bond, from the fund's returns, and then dividing by the standard deviation of returns. For example, if fund A and fund B both have 3-year returns of 15%, and fund A has a Sharpe ratio of 1.40 and fund B has a Sharpe ratio of 1.25, you can chooses fund A, as it has given higher risk-adjusted return. Better risk adjusted returns 0.73vs0.68 Category Avg Treynor's RatioTreynor's ratio indicates how much excess return was generated for each unit of risk taken. Higher the value means, fund has been able to give better returns for the amount of risk taken. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free return, defined as an Indian Government Bond, from the fund's returns, and then dividing by the beta of returns. For example, if fund A and fund B both have 3-year returns of 15%, and fund A has a Treynor's ratio of 1.40 and fund B has a Treynor's ratio of 1.25, then you can chooses fund A, as it has given higher risk-adjusted return. Better risk adjusted returns 0.16vs0.15 Category Avg Jension's AlphaAlpha indicates how fund generated additional returns compared to a benchmark. Let's say if a fund A benchmarks its returns with Nifty50 returns then alpha equal to 1.0 indicates the fund has beaten the nifty returns by 1%, so the higher the alpha, the better.

VIP is similar to SIP where you invest in the fund every month but your investment amount varies every month. How to achieve this? You can invest with simple formula: Let’s say you started VIP on 1st Jan, 2017 starting with ₹10000 and first instalment was processed at NAV of ₹100. Now if you want to change your investment amount by 10% for every 5% change in NAV then on all subsequent instalment dates, you need to check NAV and compare the same with first NAV (ie ₹100 in our example) and based on difference, you need to adjust amount. For example 1st Jan, 2018 NAV is 120 (which is higher by 20% from first NAV) than you need to reduce your investment by 40% (new instalment amount will be ₹6000).

High volatility 21.24vs18.21 Category Avg BetaBeta value gives idea about how volatile fund performance has been compared to similar funds in the market. Lower beta implies the fund gives more predictable performance compared to similar funds in the market. So if you are comparing 2 funds (lets say Fund A and Fund B) in the same category. If Fund A and Fund B has given 9% returns in last 3 years, but Fund A beta value is lower than Fund B. So you can say that there is a higher chance that Fund A will continue giving similar returns in future also whereas Fund B returns may vary. High volatility 0.96vs0.83 Category Avg Sharpe RatioSharpe ratio indicates how much risk was taken to generate the returns. Higher the value means, fund has been able to give better returns for the amount of risk taken. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free return, defined as an Indian Government Bond, from the fund's returns, and then dividing by the standard deviation of returns. For example, if fund A and fund B both have 3-year returns of 15%, and fund A has a Sharpe ratio of 1.40 and fund B has a Sharpe ratio of 1.25, you can chooses fund A, as it has given higher risk-adjusted return. Better risk adjusted returns 0.73vs0.68 Category Avg Treynor's RatioTreynor's ratio indicates how much excess return was generated for each unit of risk taken. Higher the value means, fund has been able to give better returns for the amount of risk taken. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free return, defined as an Indian Government Bond, from the fund's returns, and then dividing by the beta of returns. For example, if fund A and fund B both have 3-year returns of 15%, and fund A has a Treynor's ratio of 1.40 and fund B has a Treynor's ratio of 1.25, then you can chooses fund A, as it has given higher risk-adjusted return. Better risk adjusted returns 0.16vs0.15 Category Avg Jension's AlphaAlpha indicates how fund generated additional returns compared to a benchmark. Let's say if a fund A benchmarks its returns with Nifty50 returns then alpha equal to 1.0 indicates the fund has beaten the nifty returns by 1%, so the higher the alpha, the better. Better risk adjusted returns 1.15vs1.1 Category Avg  ||  Alternative Funds (Category Peers) Scheme Name Crisil Rank Asset Size (Cr) 1M 3M 6M 1Y 3Y Nippon India Large Cap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth 3 11279.24 -3.31 4.11 13.69 43.09 15.07 Franklin India Bluechip Fund - Direct - Growth 3 6849.25 -3.44 4.07 9.03 41.08 17.37 Invesco India Largecap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth 4 428.69 -2.58 4.99 17.50 40.60 19.54 Mahindra Manulife Large Cap Pragati Yojana - Direct Plan - Growth NA 136.87 -3.60 4.24 11.72 40.28 0.00 IDBI India Top 100 Equity Fund - Direct Plan - Growth 5 552.72 -3.95 3.09 14.10 38.46 20.62 ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund - Direct Plan - Growth 3 31081.90 -3.03 4.31 13.46 37.60 17.66 UTI Mastershare Unit Scheme - Direct Plan - Growth 4 9725.73 -2.66 4.52 14.88 37.37 19.52 Union Largecap Fund - Direct Plan - Growth 4 217.87 -3.29 4.92 15.58 37.12 18.18 HDFC Top 100 Fund - Direct Plan - Growth 1 21595.61 -4.15 3.66 9.25 36.83 13.94 Sundaram Bluechip Fund - Direct Plan - Growth NA 1279.84 -2.79 1.54 13.49 36.39 0.00 Detailed Comparison Detailed Comparison  ||  More Funds from Tata Mutual FundOut of 46 mutual fund schemes offered by this AMC,1 is/are ranked 5 * ,8 is/are ranked 3 * ,6 is/are ranked 2 * ,7 is/are ranked 1 * ,and 24 schemes are not ranked.
